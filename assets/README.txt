BACKGROUND IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Please add your animated background GIF to this folder with the filename "background.gif".

The background image is referenced in the CSS as:
background: url('assets/background.gif') no-repeat center center;

For best results:
1. Use a high-quality image that looks good when tiled or stretched
2. The image should be dark enough to allow white text to be readable
3. Recommended dimensions: at least 1920x1080px for full-screen coverage
4. Keep the file size reasonable (under 2MB if possible) to ensure fast loading

If you prefer to use a static image instead of a GIF, you can use a JPG or PNG file and update the CSS reference in styles.css accordingly.
